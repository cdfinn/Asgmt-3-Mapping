                "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” once-again president elect Donald Trump said late on election night.
    <br>
    <br>
Trump has once again shocked the nation with a second victory, this time even securing a razor-thin win in the popular vote for the first time. For the last several weeks, pundits across party wings and the ideological spectrum have tried to make sense of what they present as a coast-to-coast embrace of Trumpist politics.
<br>
<br>
Election result data from Cook Political Report and CNN, however, show a fairly modest increase in the votes Trump actually earned compared to his 2020 loss. Nationally, Trump secured about 3 million more votes in 2024 than 2020, a difference of nearly 4%. Across the board, total turnout fell by almost 3% from the 2020 presedential election.
